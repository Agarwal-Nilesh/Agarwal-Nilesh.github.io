**What?** 
---

The objective of this project is to design a supporter that will aid in wearing face masks. The supporter will be designed to provide a secure and comfortable fit for any normal day mask, allowing for prolonged usage without discomfort or slippage.

Additionally, the supporter design will need to be easy to use and adjust, so that users can quickly and easily obtain a secure and comfortable for people to wear face masks, thereby promoting good public health practices and helping to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.


**How?**
---

- The supporter designed to aid in wearing face masks was created using SolidWorks, a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) software. 

- The design takes into account a range of factors, including the size and shape of the mask, the materials used in the construction of the mask and the supporter, and the ergonomics of the human face and head.

- To ensure that the supporter would fit perfectly, the Scann 3D app was used to take precise measurements of each individual's face. This allowed for a customized fitting for each user and improved the overall design of the supporter.

- Multiple iterations and concepts were developed to ensure that the final design was functional and effective. These concepts were developed through extensive testing to ensure that the supporter would be comfortable, secure, and durable.

Results:
---

- The designed part is produced quickly and easily using Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing while also being lightweight and cost-effective.

- the design is a testament to the power and potential of rapid prototyping technology and highlights how it can be leveraged to create innovative and functional designs that meet the needs of today's fast-paced world.
