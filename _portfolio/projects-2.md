**What?** (Project Mission)
---
Simulate the colonization of Mars by designing as well as building a radio-controlled primary aircraft capable of releasing secondary autonomously guided colonist delivery aircraft (CDA) and supply payloads for the survival of the colonists.

The CDA needs to be an autonomous glider under 255 grams without any propulsion system. The supply payloads are Nerf howlers and Water bottles. The Final Flight Score is directly proportional to the days of habitability of the colonists.

**How?**
---

Led a team of engineers and designers to develop the Vulcan, an Advanced Class aircraft designed to meet the requirements of SAE Aero Design East 2021. The project involved utilizing a comprehensive and coordinated approach to ensure that all aspects of the design were thoroughly validated. Through effective management and collaboration, the team successfully developed a highly competitive aircraft that exceeded all project requirements.

My Role:
---

- Member of the Structures and Analysis Department of Team Assailing Falcons.
- Analyzed requirements, performed trade-studies, and designed the CAD model of wing and empennage structure of the aircraft using SolidWorks. Developed a detailed model that incorporated design specifications, performance requirements, and safety considerations.
- Optimized Design for Manufacturability and Assembly (DFM/A) techniques to optimize assemblies, which led to a significant 25% reduction in Bill of Materials (BOM) cost.
- Applied Finite Element Analysis (FEA) techniques to validate the design of various aircraft structures, including ribs, wings, spars. Utilized FEA results to evaluate the performance of different materials and design configurations, refine the design, and make necessary adjustments to optimize the aircraft structure for weight, cost, and performance.
- Responsible for drafting the Technical Design Report containing every aspect of making the aircraft in detail and produced technical 2D Drawings with the application of GD&T to endure precise and accurate specifications for all components.
- Collaborated with cross-functional department to ensure that all aspects of the design were fully integrated and aligned with project goals and objectives.
- Developed a range of marketing materials to engage with supporters through personalized bulk email communications.
