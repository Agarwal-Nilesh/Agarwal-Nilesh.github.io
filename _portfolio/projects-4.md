**What?** 
---
Primary objective of the invention is to provide each examinee with a device that will make use of a camera having two axes of freedom for rotation, in order to entirely monitor the environment of the examinee.

**How?** (My Role:)
---

The secondary camera is designed to be tamper proof. It is housed within an acrylic/glass housing. A one-way tinted glass and a symmetrical design make it far more challenging to determine which direction the camera is facing. The parts of the enclosure holding the components are constructed in a step-by-step process. Random pieces being taken out or broken off won't cause it to dismantle but becoming tamper-evident. It blocks any effort by a user to interact physically or electronically with the device without authorization. Only by attempting or completely disassembling the target product may the tamper mechanisms be uncovered. This could need the acquisition of many devices by the user in order to sacrifice one for the express purpose of identifying such techniques.

Tight encapsulation and one-way security screws are employed as tamper-resistant features. Implementing narrow airflow channels, that is, densely packing the components within the enclosure, will make optical probing of the interior components more difficult. 
Further, a switch is provided within the structure of the device. If the device is opened, this switch, which has been held in the pressed position, is released, thereby triggering an alarm


Results:
---

- The topology of the structure was optimized to reach the final design.
- Using FDM printing, the structure is printed and the mechanism is actuated using servos
