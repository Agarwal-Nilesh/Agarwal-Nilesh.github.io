**What?**
---
Simulate the fighting of forest fires by designing and building a radio-controlled primary aircraft (PA) capable of releasing secondary autonomously guided payload delivery aircraft (PADA) and supply payloads, including water and ground vehicle parts to  extinguish the fire.

The powered autonomous delivery aircraft (PADA) is required to weigh less than 255 grams and be released from the primary aircraft using a dropping mechanism. Additionally, the PADA must house the parts of a ground transport vehicle (GTV) that is capable of navigating through a maze. The primary payload is water, and the Final Flight Score is directly proportional to the quantity of water delivered, the number of PADA releases that are successful and the effciency of assemblling the GTV.

**How?**
---

Using a systems engineering approach, Trident was designed, fabricated, and tested to fulfill all the targets set by the team for the SAE Aero Design East 2022 competition. To increase the primary aircraft's (PA) structural durability without compromising its economic design, weight reduction techniques and composite layups were incorporated, resulting in a high strength-to-weight ratio. The designed ground transport vehicle (GTV) facilitated the rapid and efficient delivery of water, with excellent packing efficiency and minimal weight.
