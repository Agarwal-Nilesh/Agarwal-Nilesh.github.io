My name is Nilesh Agarwal, a highly motivated mechanical engineering student at the [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), with a GPA of 8.97 out of 10. Throughout my academic journey, I have been deeply involved in various research and development projects. Moreover, I led the Structures and Analysis department at [Assailing Falcons](https://assailingfalcons.in/), a team that attained the 3rd position Worldwide and 1st position in Asia in the SAE Aero Design Competition. With my passion for mechanical design and expertise in operational project management, I have designed and optimized innovative and efficient systems that cater to diverse industry requirements. My unique blend of technical expertise and strategic thinking enables me to excel in a competitive environment. My academic journey has honed my skills in managing resources efficiently, team collaboration, and problem-solving under stringent timelines.  

I encourage you to take a look at my online portfolio, which details my projects and experiences.
