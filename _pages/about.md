##Hi there!##

This is Nilesh Agarwal on the web!


I am Nilesh Agarwal, currently in my 3rd year pursuing mechanical engineering from Vellore institute of technology. I like to create and develop solutions using mechanical design. Talking about my experience and knowledge apart from my core branch of study, I’ve been a part an International Aero design team that is team assailing falcons. It’s around 2 years since I’m in the team initially as an intern and now as a structural and an analysis head. Skills such as teamwork, work ethics, adaptability define me. My technical skills include aircraft structure designing, its hardware engineering, software such as Solidworks, Ansys, Blender, Illustrator, etc.,
